#### This guide assumes the following:
* A good understanding of JavaScript.
    - Some good references for JavaScript can be found on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp) or [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide). 
    - Good beginner courses can be found on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) or [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/JavaScript/).
* Access to an iOS device.
* iOS 14 or later.
* You have the Scriptable installed on your device from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188) or [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uN1vTqxk).

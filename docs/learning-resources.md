Scriptable uses Apple's [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore), which supports [ECMAScript 6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp).
This page includes our recommendations for some of the best external resources available to learn JavaScript.

### Learning Javascript
* [W3Schools JavaScript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/).
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

:::caution

Some guides and tutorials will assume that you're running JavaScript in a browser and therefore have access to browser-specific objects, such as `window`, `document`, and `navigator`. **Scriptable does not run JavaScript in a browser, so such objects do not exist.**

### Learning HTML & CSS
* W3Schools' [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) & [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) tutorials.
* W3Schools' [HTML Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp) & [Javascript DOM CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_css.asp) for implementing HTML and CSS into Javascript.

### Learning regular expressions (RegEx)
